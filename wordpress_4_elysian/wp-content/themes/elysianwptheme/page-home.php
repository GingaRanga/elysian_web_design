                            <p>The clients wanted to create something unique and special for their wedding website, which they felt could not be obtained by using the cheaper template site builders available. They wanted to create a user experience, which would be seamless for the wide variety of guests using the site. The wedding colours needed to be integrated throughout the whole design and the important info needed to be clearly presented. The money saved on creating custom invitations and updates was utilized to create a more functional presentation via their website. All of the above was accomplished whilst working with the clients from start to finish.</p>

                            <h3>Dynamic Wedding Website</h3> 
                            <p>The clients wanted to create something unique and special for their wedding website, which they felt could not be obtained by using the cheaper template site builders available. They wanted to create a user experience, which would be seamless for the wide variety of guests using the site. The wedding colours needed to be integrated throughout the whole design and the important info needed to be clearly presented. The money saved on creating custom invitations and updates was utilized to create a more functional presentation via their website. All of the above was accomplished whilst working with the clients from start to finish.</p>
